# Bestemmiometro's Dashboard's Cookie Policy

Ultimo aggiornamento: 28/08/2025

*With "us" we refer to Bestemmiometro's developer team and collaborators*
*With "our services" we refer to Bestemmiometro, to its Dashboard and to its API*

Bestemmiometro's Dashboard stores the following cookies:

1. `sessionId`
    - **Cookie Type**: essential.
    - **First-party or Third-party**: First-Party.
    - **Purpose**: stores the ID of the current session, which the API associates to the current user's Discord access token, obtained through OAuth2. It is essential to the Dashboard's pages which require authentication (the "Login con Discord" button) and which allow users to interface themselves, through the Dashboard, with our other services.
    - **Can I withdraw consent to its storage?**: Yes, the cookie will not be stored if the user is not authenticated (if the user doesn't click the "Login con Discord" button). If the cookie is stored already, the user can delete it by logging out (Profile Picture Icon => Logout)
